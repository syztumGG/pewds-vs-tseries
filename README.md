# PewDiePie vs. T-Series [![downloads](https://img.shields.io/npm/dt/pewds-vs-tseries.svg?color=%234cb9fa&style=flat-square)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/pewds-vs-tseries)
Tracks both channels' subscriber counts and outputs them into the terminal.

## Motivation
I wanted to play with stdout but didn't know what to make. Decided to publish to NPM just in case anyone else wants to build from this.

## Learning
Learned a lot about stdout (as intended) and the various packages/tools people use to create complex CLIs.

## Installation
```npm i -g pewds-vs-tseries```

## Usage
Type `subcounter` into any terminal.
